# CS416-Final-Project


Modified dataset used to create: https://vkara5.github.io/

To create this visualization the data has been parsed and aggregated using excel from the original dataset. 
Since no external libraries were allowed except the ones mentioned, it was easier to first parse the data I was looking for and then directly call the data from the GitHub repository.
This also decreased the script size of the website and decreased any load times that would have caused by on-site processing.

*The repo name should be CS416 - got confused with the other class*
